Think of some relative or friend whom you frequently see (but is not with you at present).\ The exact contour of face, head, shoulders, and body.\ Characteristic poses of head, attitudes of body, etc.\ The precise gait, length of step, etc., in walking.\ The different colors worn in some familiar clothes.\ Visualize a rising sun.\ The sun is rising above the horizon into a hazy sky.\ The sky clears and surrounds the sun with blueness.\ Clouds. A storm blows up, with flashes of lightning.\ A rainbow appears.\ Think of the front of a shop to which you often go.\ The overall appearance of the shop from the opposite side of the road. \A window display including colors, shapes and details of individual items for sale.\ You are near the entrance. The color, shape and detail of the door.\ You enter the shop and go to the counter. The counter assistant serves you. Money changes hands.\ Think of a country scene which involves trees, mountains, and a lake.\ The contours of the landscape.\ The color and shape of the trees.\ The color and shape of the lake.\ A strong wind blows on the trees and on the lake, causing waves.\ Think of a familiar car that is not your own.\ The contours of the car body, tires, and windows.\ The color of the car in bright sun. Any scratches or details on the car body.\ The car pulling into a driveway and parking.\ The car facing you and approaching.\ Think of your dream car if you could have any car you wanted.\ The car driving on a highway.\ The contours of the car body, tires, and windows.\ The car being washed.\ The car after driving it on a muddy road.\
